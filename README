Here is branch typescript, but I haven't tested it. So if all here is okay, it can be merged in main
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Steps:

1.) npm i

2.) npm run build

3.) Commit and push changes. Make sure that you pushes dist/bundle.js file.

4.) take dist/bundle.js it is our main build file, which we will connect to website. Open it and pres Raw button.

5.) Put your github link, and transform it in cd for source code. I used this https://raw.githack.com/

!!! But don't forget if you use production mode, if you push new changes, they will be cached from previous branch.
So you need to open your new commit, open version of file and repeat the previous operation.

6.) Put your url in link <head></head>

7.) Add newLinkBoomio in script higher, for api link

Example:

<head>
     <script>
        const newLinkBoomio = "https://api.mars.boomio.com/easter-service/get-qr-code";
    </script>
    <script src="https://rawcdn.githack.com/boomio-api-v2/final-combined-wdigets-1/faa3751938a8edcf41d95c83a58bcd0b55563278/dist/bundle.js"></script>
</head>


Task list:
1.) Fixed eslint issues.
2.) Put Qrcode script in project eviroment
